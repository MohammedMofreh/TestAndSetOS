# TestAndSetOS
Test-and-Set is a synchronization primitive used in concurrent programming to implement mutual exclusion, ensuring that only one thread can access a critical section of code at a time. It consists of two parts: testing the current state of a flag or variable, and setting it to a new state if certain conditions are met.
